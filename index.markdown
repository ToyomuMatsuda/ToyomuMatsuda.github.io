I am a math PhD student at Freie Universit√§t Berlin.  
My research interest is stochastic analysis. Recently I work on topics around fractional Brownian motions.  
I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Nicolas Perkowski](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/stoch/members/Professors/perkowski.html).
