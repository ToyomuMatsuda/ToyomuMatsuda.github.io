I am a math PhD student at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and a member of [International Research Training Group (IRTG) 2544](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/): Stochastic Analysis in Interaction.

My research interest is stochastic analysis. Recently I work on topics around fractional Brownian motions.  
I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Nicolas Perkowski](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/stoch/members/Professors/perkowski.html).

I am visiting Oxford from 24.09.2022 to 08.03.2023, hosted by [Rama Cont](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/rama.cont).

Before coming to Germany, I obtained M.S. from Kyushu University (supervised by [Yuzuru Inahama](https://www2.math.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~inahama/)) and B.S. from Kobe University (supervised by [Naotaka Kajino](https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~nkajino/)).
