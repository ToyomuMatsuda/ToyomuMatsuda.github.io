I am a math PhD student at Freie Universit√§t Berlin.  
My research interest is stochastic analysis. Recently I work on topics around fractional Brownian motions.  
I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Nicolas Perkowski](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/stoch/members/Professors/perkowski.html).  
I am a member of [International Research Training Group (IRTG) 2544](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/IRTG/): Stochastic Analysis in Interaction. 

Before coming to Germany, I obtained M.S. from Kyushu University (supervised by [Yuzuru Inahama](https://www2.math.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~inahama/)) and B.S. from Kobe University (supervised by [Naotaka Kajino](https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~nkajino/)). 

I was born in a beautiful place called Okinawa, Japan. 

## Preprints
1. [An extension of the stochastic sewing lemma and applications to fractional stochastic calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01686), with Nicolas Perkowski. 
2. [Integrated density of states of the Anderson Hamiltonian with two-dimensional white noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09180).
