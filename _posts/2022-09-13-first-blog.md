title:  "Doing PhD in Japan"
---

In Japan people often say that its PhD system is screwed, and unfortunately I have to agree with it.
At the same time, there are few Japanese pursuing a PhD outside of Japan. I couldn't find any data on it, but
I guess that they are less than 10 (even 5) % of those pursuing PhD in Japan.
For instance, I was the only person, among math master students (around 40 students) at my previous university (Kyushu university) in 2020, who
left Japan for PhD.

As an example who is pursuing a math PhD in Germany, here I want to compare the PhD system (math) in these two countries.
If you want to share the PhD system in your country, I appreciate it if you leave a comment below.

## Funding
In Japan, most PhD students try to get funding from Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (日本学術支援機構).
For this there are two applications: DC1 and DC2. Let me explain DC1 first.

After the end of the first-year master studies, students who want to pursue a PhD start to write an application form
of DC1. Besides basic information, they have to write (1) research proposal (3 pages), (2) self-assessment of your ability to complete the proposal (2 pages) and (3) pictures of aimed researchers (1 page).
It is written in Japanese but [here](https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/data/boshu/03_dc_naiyo.pdf) you can see
the application form.
To some degree, you have to write a proposal for any PhD application, but DC1 seems too demanding,
especially for math students who just finished the first-year master study.
I spent two months of writing the DC1 proposal and I always felt 'what the hell am I supposed to write?'.

The acceptance rate of DC1 is scary: **20 %**. This sounds even scarier if you take into consideration
the number of PhD students in Japan, which I will discuss later. How come a developed country like Japan
funds only 20 percent of PhD students? By the way, I failed DC1.

In Germany, I have never seen PhD students who are not funded. As for math PhD study in Berlin,
there are at least three major ways to get funding. The first is to receive scholarship from the Berlin Mathematical
School. The second is to become a member of a research project. The disadvantage is that you are a part of a research
project and hence you cannot always do whatever research you want to do.
The third, which applies to me, is to be employed by a university through some project. In some cases you have teaching duties.
