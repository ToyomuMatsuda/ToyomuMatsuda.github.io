It is often more interesting to know the process of writing a paper than
to understand the paper itself. Here I record my journey on writing the
paper "An extension of the stochastic sewing lemma and its
applications to fractional stochastic calculus".

It started around the middle of 2021. As a member of PhD program, I was
supposed to visit Oxford for research. At that time I was mainly working
on a topic called singular SPDE, which was a new and active field after
Hairer received the Field medal in 2014. But no professor in Oxford
worked on singular SPDE (as this was one year before Gubinelli joined
Oxford), and this means that to visit Oxford, I needed to find a new
topic that interests a professor in Oxford. Actually this was a good
opportunity for me. The field of singular SPDE witnessed extremely rapid
speed of progress after Hairer's breakthrough, and as a result there
were already enough strong researchers in that field and I felt
inadequacy to continue to work on singular SPDE. So I asked Nicolas (my
supervisor) about this, and he suggests to check some papers of Rama
Cont, as Nicolas had some works with him.

Rama Cont is a giant in the mathematical finance and, as I was not
familiar with math finance, it was not easy for me to find a paper of
him that I can actually understand. Fortunately, his latest paper at
that time was about excursion. This is a topic of pure probability
theory and without fluency in math finance I was able to understand a
large part of the paper (although the paper is motivated by applications
to finance). Then, Nicolas, Rama and I had a zoom meeting to organize my
stay in Oxford and to discuss a possible project. I must admit that this
was an embarrassing meeting for me: basically Nicolas and Rama were
discussing ideas and I only said a couple of very simple sentences such
as ``that problem sounds interesting''. This was not only
because their discussion is at too high level for me but also because I
was too nervous to talk with Rama. This was my first time to talk with
such a big figure.

After the meeting I was a bit lost in a sense that I didn't know
concretely which problem I should work on. Probably Nicolas felt it, and
he suggested me a concrete problem. It is an open problem from the paper
with Nicolas and Rama, and it is about fractional Brownian motion (or
fractional stochastic calculus, a phrase from the title of our paper).
This was the first time for me to learn fractional stochastic calculus,
and as such novice how come I can solve the problem that Nicolas and
Rama left open! Luckily Nicolas is such a friendly professor that we
have lunch together with other members of his group. During lunch I
discussed the problem, and Nicolas suggested me to use <i>stochastic
sewing lemma</i>, another key phrase from the title of our paper.

The [stochastic sewing lemma](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-probability/volume-25/issue-none/A-stochastic-sewing-lemma-and-applications/10.1214/20-EJP442.full) was a result proved by Khoa LÃª, and
was regarded as a breakthrough result in Berlin community. For a week I spent almost all my effort to read the paper,
and it was a very beautiful paper! No wonder why it was (and is as of writing) so popular in Berlin.
However, it was no obvious how one can use the stochastic sewing to tackle the problem of Nicolas and Rama.
During another lunch, we talked about it, and he suggested a simpler problem: for a fractional
Brownian motion $$B^H$$ with Hurst parameter $$H \in (0, 1)$$ it is well-known that


$$
\lim_{\vert \pi \vert \to 0} \sum_{[s,t] \in \pi} \vert B^H_t - B^H_s \vert^{1/H} = c_H,
$$


where $\pi$ is a partition of $[0, 1]$ and $c_H$ is a some constant.
